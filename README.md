# PythonJs-Flask


I have developed a project that consists of a Flask backend and a Next.js & React frontend.
The backend API, implemented in Python, is responsible for fetching data and serving it to the frontend. 
The frontend, built with Next.js & React, receives the data from the backend and displays it to the user.

First: I have set up the frontend and the backend. 
- server folder: Containing backend
-  client folder: Containing the frontend

Second: I have created two seperate terminals to install what is needed. 

BackEnd:
- Created a virtual environment in the server folder.
- Then activated the virtual environment
- Then created a server python file.
- Lasty, installed Flask. 

FrontEnd:
- Installed (npx create-next-app .) 

Third: I then created the Flask backend in the server python file. 
 - Created an app instance to create a Flask app.
 - Created an app route with only accepting a "Get" method.
